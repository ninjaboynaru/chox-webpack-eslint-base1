# Chox Webpack and ESLint integration base project #1
This project acts as a scaffold for future projects requiring Webpack with ESLint integrated into the build process.  
It's setup such that the linting configuration is easy to manage and expand upon.  

It's also a fine and simple example for beginners to learn from

## ESLint Configuration
The main ESLint configuration is in `.eslintrc.js` which extends more individualized esint configurations stored in the `linting` folder.
